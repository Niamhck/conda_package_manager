# Conda Package Manager

This repository contains two short bash scripts that will automatically check packages in your python files and update them automatically. 

Since this is automatic, please do **NOT** use these scripts in conda environments you are maintaining as it could cause dependency issues
Use these scripts in conda environments you explore or experiment in
